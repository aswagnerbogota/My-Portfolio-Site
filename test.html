                    Hey there my name is Andre. I was born and raised in a small town in Germany and spent the first 16 years of my life there before moving to Atlanta, GA back in 2007. While in Georgia I attended Starr's Mill High School in Fayetteville.  In my early 20's I went back to Germany multiple times where I traveled to many different countries in Europe.<br>
                    My passion for computers started back in Germany where I built my first computer with the age of 13. Ever since I have been fascinated with technology and learning more about it. When I was 22 I started a career with Apple as a Technician. After working with them for over 1,5 years I decided to take another opportunity with Verizon to earn a little bit more money so I can start traveling the world. After a few months it was finally time to leave and I gave up my job, got on a plane, and flew to Medellin, Colombia. I traveled to many different places over the next few months until I decided to take a job as an English teacher in Bogota, Colombia. While in Bogota I also volunteered at a Coworking & Coliving Space called Magicville in return for free rent. I met many people that stayed from a few days to multiple months that are professional programmers.<br>
                    That was when I realized that I found a new field of work. Ever since I have been spending almost every free minute of my time learning more and furthering my education. I have been taking classes on edX, programs thru freecodecamp, and teaching myself with many other online resources. I'm very excited for the what the future brings for me in this field.<br>
                    Now that I'm back in the United States I'm spending all my time trying to learn more and more and hope to be able to work in the field very soon.
